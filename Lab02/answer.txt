Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer: Yes.
  “Overloading” allows multiple constructors of the same name as long as they have different signatures (i.e. (1) order, (2) type(s) or (3) number of parameters). The constructors in question have different parameters (“title” and “category”) so both constructors are valid.
